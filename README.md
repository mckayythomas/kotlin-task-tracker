# kotlin-task-tracker

# Overview

This software was made to help me learn the Kotlin language and to build a small task tracker for personal use. This was a very helpful project to enable me to get the basics of Kotlin down including using classes. A small data class is used to store tasks and manage them as well as a text file that acts as a small database. As a console-driven app, this is a small but powerful little software. 

To run this software one will need to install the IntelliJ IDEA Community edition to compile and run the Kotlin code. The installation link can be found here [Install IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
Upon installation, you can clone the repository and follow the Demo video below.

For additional help in installing the IntelliJ IDEA by Jet Brains, the first 5 minutes of the Code Academy Helpful video below has a small walkthrough for this.

# Development Environment

IntelliJ was used to build this software using the Kotlin language. the default settings were used upon installation and a blank Kotlin project was started. This is a console-driven app with no user interface. A small text file is used for data storage and data reading.

# Future Work

This was a smaller project with lots of more potential. Some future fixes would be:
- Refactoring code to be more reusable: A utility class would come in great help to help reduce lines of code and make the project follow closer OOP principles.
- Error handling: Input validation is present but more specific error handling would be wise to handle any unforeseen issues. This would be great with a few try catch blocks.
- Adding a UI: For the purpose of learning the Kotlin language this was sufficient. In the future, adding a UI would give a cleaner and easier-to-use application.
